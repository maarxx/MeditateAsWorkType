# Introduction and Explanation

The mod allows you to configure Meditation in the Work tab instead of the Schedule tab.

You'll find two new columns in the "Work" tab:

* Meditate (P) - meditate for psyfocus, per the configured target threshold on the pawn's widget.
* Meditate (A) - meditate to grow anima grass, as a tribal pawn, even without a psylink.

This lets you do things, like, have the pawn also be a Doctor, and they will automatically ping back and forth between doctoring and meditating, which is impossible using the Schedule tab method.
